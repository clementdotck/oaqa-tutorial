uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation ﻿"Life sciences is one of the emerging markets at the heart of IBM's growth strategy," said John M. Thompson, IBM senior vice president & group executive, Software. "This investment is the first of a number of steps we will be taking to advance IBM's life sciences initiatives." In his role as newly appointed IBM Corporation vice chairman, effective September 1, Mr. Thompson will be responsible for integrating and accelerating IBM's efforts to exploit life sciences and other emerging growth areas.  IBM estimates the market for IT solutions for life sciences will skyrocket from $3.5 billion today to more than $9 billion by 2003. Driving demand is the explosive growth in genomic, proteomic and pharmaceutical research. For example, the Human Genome Database is approximately three terabytes of data, or the equivalent of 150 million pages of information. The volume of life sciences data is doubling every six months.   "All of this genetic data is worthless without the information technology that can help scientists manage and analyze it to unlock the pathways that will lead to new cures for many of today's diseases," said Dr. Caroline Kovac, vice president of IBM's new Life Sciences unit. "IBM can help speed this process by enabling more efficient interpretation of data and sharing of knowledge. The potential for change based on innovation in life sciences is bigger than the change caused by the digital circuit."  Among the life sciences initiatives already underway at IBM are: - DiscoveryLink* -- For the first time, researchers using this combination of innovative middleware and integration services can join together information from many sources to solve complex medical research problems. DiscoveryLink creates a "virtual database" that permits data to be accessed and extracted from multiple data sources used in research and development projects. This IT solution can dramatically improve product cycle time and lower development costs for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and agri-science companies.   - Blue Gene* - IBM is building a supercomputer 100 times faster than any available today designed to advance understanding of the mechanisms behind protein folding through large-scale biomolecular simulation. In December, IBM committed $100 million to this five-year research project to advance the state-of-the-art in supercomputing for biological applications. - Bio-Dictionary* -- IBM has compiled a protein dictionary containing some 30 million protein "words" designed to accelerate the understanding of protein shapes and functions.Bio-Dictionaries for selected genomes, as well as bioinformatics algorithms for pattern discovery and other relevant applications, are available to scientists and researchers for noncommercial use through a website dedicated to life sciences content at http://www.research.ibm.com/compsci/compbio/.  * Indicates trademark or registered trademark of IBM Corporation.

uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation ﻿UIT Seminar: Challenges in Speech Recognition   August 8, 2003   10:30 AM - 11:30 AM    Lawrence Rabiner , Associate Director CAIP, Rutgers    University, Professor Univ. of Santa Barbara      Yorktown 20-043   Availability: Open     Speech recognition has matured to the point where it   is now being widely applied in a range of applications   including desktop dictation, cell phone name dialing,   agent technology, automated operator services,   telematics, call center automation and help desks.    Although the technology is often good enough for many   of these applications, there remain key challenges in   virtually every aspect of speech recognition that   prevent the technology from being used ubiquitously in   any environment, for any speaker, and for an even   broader range of applications. This talk will analyze   the ‘Speech Circle’ that enables a person to maintain   a dialog with a machine using speech recognition,   spoken language understanding, dialog management and   spoken language generation, and finally text-to-speech   synthesis, and show where significant progress has   been made, and where there remain critical problems   that need to be addressed and solved.    The talk will include several audio and video examples   of speech recognition and speech understanding systems   that have been studied in the laboratory to illustrate   the challenges that remain to be solved before speech   recognition is considered a solved problem.

uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation ﻿Adventurous Research Summer Seminar Series - Trainable Information Extraction Systems  August 19, 2003   02:00 PM - 03:30 PM   David Johnson, Frank Oles, Tong Zhang(IBM Research)     Hawthorne GN-F15  Availability: Open    The technical objective of the TIES project is to build customizable systems that can identify named entities in text, such as persons, organizations, and locations, as well as identifying relations between those entities. The technical approach is to develop new statistical and symbolic machine learning algorithms in service of the technical objective. Also, we are working on combining statistical with symbolic techniques. The first part of this talk, given by David E. Johnson, will provide a general overview of the goals of the TIES project. The second part, given by Tong Zhang, will provide background on applying statistical machine learning to this problem domain. Tong will also describe the particular statistical approach taken, which is termed Robust Risk Minimization (RMM). The final part will be given by Frank J. Oles. Frank will introduce his theory of precedence-inclusion patterns. Precedence-inclusion patterns are mathematical structures possessing multiple interacting strict partial orders that satisfy axioms generalizing the familiar properties of irreflexivity and transitivity. This very general theory provides a radically new approach to symbolic, as opposed to statistical, pattern generalization that can be applied to relational learning in a number of settings, including learning based on text, on images, or on videos.
